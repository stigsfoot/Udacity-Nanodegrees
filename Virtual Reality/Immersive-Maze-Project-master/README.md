# VRND Project 3 The Maze README

The goal for Udacity's VRND P3, was to design and create an interactive maze scene that is large enough to spend a few minutes moving around. 
Project has to have animations, effects, good use of lighting, and must be fun. **I've also hidden an easter egg as part of the game**
**Note:** _This project took approximately 12 hours (off and on) to complete and is my submission as part of the *"VRND"* or Virtual Reality Nanodegree. I will be using this for these video tutorials._
**Thoughts** This is one of my favorite projects. Most challenging was triggering the Door class to unlock when the artifact was collected. I like the fact that this project gets pretty into C# and Unity dev.

### Optional [TO DO]:

* Non-diegetic HUD UI for holding timer/points
 * Simple player timer rendered to World Space
 * Simple coin counter rendered in a UI
* Add focus state to Sign Post for better VRUX


## Getting Started

Assumes you have a Google Cardboard device, a phone and the corresponding APK :D. With the app launched, click on the floating cubes to naviate around the maze. 
Collect coins by gazing with your reticle on the coin game object. The goal is to locate a suprise artifact to find collect which also unlocks the Temple door.
Opening the temple door and finding the treasures within wins the Maze game.
