# VRND Project 2 Modern Apartment README

The goal for Udacity's Virtual Reality project 2, was to design and create an apartment scene that includes 3D models. 
Project has to have animation and adequate lighting. 
Note: _This project is my submission as part of the *"VRND"* or Virtual Reality Nanodegree. I will be using this for these video tutorials._


## Getting Started

Assumes you have a Google Cardboard device, a phone and the corresponding APK :D. With the app launched, the trigger (click) teleports you around the 
apartment. Feel free to look around and enjoy the _ambient city sounds_, also, admire the easter eggs and paintings etc. Trigger the planet's rotation by 
gazing with your reticle on on the globe. Moving the reticle off the globe stops the animation.
